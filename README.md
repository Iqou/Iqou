ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m @Iqou, and Iâ€™m passionate about Game Programming, Web Development, and solving programming problems.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into C Language, JavaScript, and Python, expanding my skills and exploring new possibilities.

ðŸ§© When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me enjoying my hobbiesâ€”listening to music, playing video games, sleeping, and reading manga stories.

ðŸŽ¥ I also run a YouTube channel where I share gameplay videos for entertainment and occasional insights into coding projects Iâ€™ve been working on. Check it outâ€”you might find something fun or inspiring! @IqoYT
